The difference between `<%@ include page="./checkConnection.jsp" %>` and `<%@ include file="./checkConnection.jsp" %>` lies in how the path to the included file is resolved.

1. `<%@ include page="./checkConnection.jsp" %>`:
   - The `page` attribute in the `include` directive tag expects a context-relative path.
   - The path specified in `page` is relative to the current JSP page's URL.
   - It takes into account the context path and any URL mappings that may be present.
   - For example, if the current JSP file's URL is `http://example.com/mypage.jsp`, the included file's path `./checkConnection.jsp` would be resolved to `http://example.com/checkConnection.jsp`.

2. `<%@ include file="./checkConnection.jsp" %>`:
   - The `file` attribute in the `include` directive tag expects a filesystem-relative or absolute path.
   - The path specified in `file` is relative to the file system structure of the web application.
   - It does not consider the current JSP page's URL or any URL mappings.
   - For example, if the web application is deployed at `/path/to/webapp`, and the included file's path is `./checkConnection.jsp`, it would be resolved to `/path/to/webapp/checkConnection.jsp`.

In summary, the key difference is that the `page` attribute resolves the path based on the current JSP page's URL, while the `file` attribute resolves the path based on the file system structure of the web application.

It's important to choose the appropriate attribute based on your specific requirements and the intended behavior of the inclusion.
