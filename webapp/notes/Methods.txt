There are several other methods in Java and JSP (JavaServer Pages) that are commonly used in web application development. These methods are part of the Java Servlet and JSP API, and they provide various functionalities for handling HTTP requests, managing sessions, working with databases, and more. Here are some commonly used methods and classes:

1. **HttpServletRequest and HttpServletResponse Methods**:
   - `getParameter()`: Retrieves values of request parameters sent in the URL or form data.
   - `setAttribute()`: Sets an attribute in the request scope.
   - `getInputStream()`: Gets the input stream for reading binary data in the request.
   - `getWriter()`: Gets a PrintWriter object for sending text-based output in the response.
   - `getSession()`: Retrieves or creates a session object associated with the request.

2. **HttpSession Methods**:
   - `getAttribute()`: Retrieves an attribute from the session scope.
   - `setAttribute()`: Sets an attribute in the session scope.
   - `invalidate()`: Invalidates the session, removing all session attributes.
   - `isNew()`: Checks if the session is new (just created).

3. **ServletContext Methods**:
   - `getAttribute()`: Retrieves an attribute from the application (servlet context) scope.
   - `setAttribute()`: Sets an attribute in the application scope.

4. **RequestDispatcher Methods**:
   - `forward()`: Forwards a request to another servlet or JSP page.
   - `include()`: Includes the output of another servlet or JSP page in the response.

5. **JSP Expression Language (EL)**:
   - EL provides expressions and operators for simplifying access to JavaBean properties, collections, and maps in JSP pages. Common EL functions include `${expression}`, `${requestScope.attribute}`, `${sessionScope.attribute}`, `${param.parameter}`, etc.

6. **Database Access (JDBC)**:
   - Java provides classes and methods for database access through JDBC (Java Database Connectivity). Common JDBC methods include `Connection.prepareStatement()`, `ResultSet.next()`, `Statement.execute()`, etc.

7. **Cookie Handling**:
   - `HttpServletRequest.getCookies()`: Retrieves an array of cookies from the request.
   - `HttpServletResponse.addCookie()`: Adds a cookie to the response.

8. **Redirection and URL Handling**:
   - `HttpServletResponse.sendRedirect()`: Redirects the client to another URL.
   - `java.net.URL`: A class for working with URLs programmatically.

9. **Exception Handling**:
   - Exception handling methods like `try`, `catch`, and `throw` are used to handle exceptions in Java and JSP applications.

These are just a few examples, and there are many more methods and classes available in Java and JSP for various purposes in web application development. The choice of methods depends on the specific requirements of your application.
