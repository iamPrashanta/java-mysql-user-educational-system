In Java, when working with databases, `executeQuery` and `executeUpdate` are two methods provided by the `Statement` interface (or its subclasses like `PreparedStatement`) to interact with the database. They serve different purposes:

1. **executeQuery()**:
   - This method is used to execute SQL queries that return a result set, typically used for `SELECT` queries.
   - It returns a `ResultSet` object, which represents the data retrieved from the database.
   - Example use cases include fetching data from a table or executing a `SELECT` query to retrieve records.

   ```java
   ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM users");
   ```

2. **executeUpdate()**:
   - This method is used to execute SQL queries that modify the database, such as `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, and `CREATE` operations.
   - It returns an integer value representing the number of rows affected by the SQL statement.
   - Example use cases include inserting new records, updating existing records, or deleting records from a table.

   ```java
   int rowsAffected = statement.executeUpdate("UPDATE users SET name = 'John' WHERE id = 123");
   ```

In summary, `executeQuery` is used for retrieving data from the database, while `executeUpdate` is used for making changes to the database. The returned result types and the way you use them in your code differ accordingly.



3. **PreparedStatement**:

PreparedStatement is an interface in Java that is used to execute parameterized SQL queries against a relational database. It's a feature provided by JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) to work with databases in a more efficient and secure way compared to standard Statement objects.

Here's why PreparedStatement is useful:

Parameterization: PreparedStatement allows you to create SQL statements with placeholders for parameters. This is useful for preventing SQL injection attacks because it automatically escapes and quotes the parameter values, making it more secure.

Performance: Prepared statements are precompiled by the database engine, which can improve performance when executing the same query multiple times with different parameter values. This is because the database engine doesn't have to re-parse and optimize the SQL statement each time.

Readability: Using placeholders in SQL queries makes the code more readable and maintainable, as you can clearly see where parameters are inserted into the query.



4. **ResultSet**:


ResultSet is an interface in Java that represents a set of results from a database query. It is a core component of JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) and is used to retrieve data from a relational database after executing a SQL query.

Here are some key points about ResultSet:

Iteration: A ResultSet acts as an iterator, allowing you to traverse through the rows of data returned by a database query one at a time.

Read-Only: By default, ResultSet objects are typically read-only, which means you can only retrieve data from the database using them. You cannot modify the database data directly through a ResultSet.

Data Access: You can use methods like getString(), getInt(), getDouble(), and others to retrieve specific column values from the current row of the ResultSet. The appropriate method is used based on the data type of the column.

Cursor: The ResultSet maintains a cursor that points to the current row. You can move the cursor using methods like next(), previous(), first(), last(), etc.

Scrollable: Some ResultSet objects can be configured to be scrollable, allowing you to move the cursor to any row in the result set.

Type and Concurrency: ResultSet objects can be of different types, such as forward-only or scroll-sensitive, and can have different concurrency levels, such as read-only or updatable.






5. **Datatype(s)**:

Java has several data types, and JSP (JavaServer Pages) inherits most of them since JSP is a technology that uses Java. Here are some common data types in Java and JSP:

1. **Primitive Data Types (Java):**
   - `int`: Integer data type.
   - `double`: Double-precision floating-point data type.
   - `float`: Single-precision floating-point data type.
   - `char`: Character data type.
   - `byte`: Byte data type.
   - `short`: Short integer data type.
   - `long`: Long integer data type.
   - `boolean`: Boolean data type.

2. **Reference Data Types (Java):**
   - `String`: Represents a sequence of characters.
   - `Object`: The root class for all Java classes.
   - Various other classes, interfaces, and custom-defined data types.

3. **Data Types in JSP:**
   - JSP uses Java data types. It doesn't introduce any new data types of its own. You can use all the primitive and reference data types available in Java within JSP.

4. **Custom Data Types (Java and JSP):**
   - In both Java and JSP, you can create your own custom data types using classes and interfaces.

5. **Arrays (Java and JSP):**
   - Both Java and JSP support arrays of various data types, including arrays of custom objects.

6. **Collections (Java and JSP):**
   - Both Java and JSP support collections like `List`, `Set`, and `Map` from the `java.util` package.

7. **Enumerations (Java and JSP):**
   - Both Java and JSP support enumerations (`enum`) to define a set of constants.

8. **Wrapper Classes (Java and JSP):**
   - Both Java and JSP have wrapper classes for primitive data types. For example, `Integer` is the wrapper class for `int`, `Double` for `double`, and so on.

9. **Date and Time Types (Java and JSP):**
   - Both Java and JSP have classes for working with date and time, such as `java.util.Date` and `java.time.LocalDate`.

10. **Custom Classes and Types (Java and JSP):**
    - You can define custom classes and types in both Java and JSP to suit your application's needs.

These are some of the most common data types available in Java and used in JSP for various programming tasks. The choice of data type depends on the specific requirements of your program or application.


******************************************

The `Connection` data type, as used in Java for database connectivity through the JDBC API, is a specialized data type designed for database operations. In this context, you'll find several other data types and classes that are closely related to database connectivity and operations. Here are some of them:

1. **Statement Types**:
   - `Statement`: Used for executing simple SQL queries.
   - `PreparedStatement`: Used for executing precompiled SQL queries with placeholders for parameters.
   - `CallableStatement`: Used for executing database stored procedures.

2. **Result Sets**:
   - `ResultSet`: Represents the result set of a database query and allows you to traverse the data retrieved from the database.

3. **Data Source and Connection Pooling**:
   - `DataSource`: Represents a factory for creating database connections. Commonly used in connection pooling scenarios.
   - Connection pool libraries like Apache DBCP and HikariCP provide their own data types and classes for managing connections.

4. **Database Metadata**:
   - `DatabaseMetaData`: Provides information about the database server, its capabilities, and the structure of the database.

5. **Exceptions**:
   - Various exception classes like `SQLException` for handling database-related errors.

These are some of the key data types and classes you'll encounter when working with database connectivity in Java applications. Each serves a specific purpose in interacting with a relational database using JDBC. Other libraries and frameworks might introduce additional data types and abstractions for specific use cases or to simplify database interactions.
