In JSP (JavaServer Pages), there are three main types of tags: scriptlet tags, directive tags, and expression tags. Additionally, there are several other specialized tags used for specific purposes. Here are the different types of tags in JSP:

1. Scriptlet Tags: `<% ... %>`
   - Used to include Java code directly within the JSP file.
   - Example: `<% int count = 5; %>`
   - Scriptlet tags allow you to write arbitrary Java code, but it is generally recommended to minimize the use of scriptlets and separate business logic from presentation using other approaches.

2. Directive Tags: `<%@ ... %>`
   - Used to provide directives or instructions to the JSP container (servlet engine) about various aspects of the JSP page.
   - Commonly used directive tags include:
     - `<%@ page ... %>`: Specifies page-specific attributes such as language, content type, imports, session behavior, etc.
     - `<%@ include ... %>`: Includes the contents of another file at the current location.
     - `<%@ taglib ... %>`: Declares and imports a custom tag library to be used in the JSP.

3. Expression Tags: `<%= ... %>`
   - Used to output the value of an expression directly into the HTML response.
   - Example: `<p>Welcome, <%= username %></p>`
   - Expression tags are a shorthand for printing the value using `out.print()`.

4. Declaration Tags: `<%! ... %>`
   - Used to declare fields or methods that are accessible throughout the JSP page.
   - Declarations are placed outside the service method but within the generated servlet class.
   - Example: `<%! int count = 5; %>`

5. XML Tags: `<jsp: ... >`
   - Used to define custom actions and control flow within the JSP file.
   - XML tags are prefixed with `jsp:` and provide additional functionality beyond the basic JSP tags.
   - Example: `<jsp:include page="header.jsp" />`

6. Standard Action Tags: `<jsp: ... >`
   - Used to perform specific actions or operations within the JSP file.
   - Standard action tags provide functionality like including other files, forwarding requests, handling exceptions, and more.
   - Example: `<jsp:include page="header.jsp" />`

7. Custom Action Tags:
   - These tags are defined by developers or third-party libraries to encapsulate reusable functionality.
   - Custom tags provide a way to extend the functionality of JSP by defining and using custom actions.
   - Example: `<myapp:customTag attribute1="value1" attribute2="value2" />`

It's important to note that the use of scriptlet tags (`<% ... %>`) is generally discouraged in favor of more structured approaches like servlets, JSTL (JSP Standard Tag Library), or custom tags to separate business logic from presentation.
